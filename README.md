# Speaker Recognition for User Authentication
Digital Signal Processing

## Abstract
In the world which requires high security standards we have focused on creating a smart system to make sure only the right person gets access. We use feature extracting method MFCC and DTW to recognize a person's voice, even in noisy situations. This system is like a secret password, but instead of typing, your voice is the key.We've added some clever filters to pick out what makes each voice unique, making our system great at telling one person's voice from another. Imagine it like a super secure room that only opens for one person. If someone else tries to get in, the system says, "Login Failed," keeping everything safe. This is 
especially useful in places where super tight security is essential. It's our way of making sure only the right people have access, keeping everything secure and sound.
